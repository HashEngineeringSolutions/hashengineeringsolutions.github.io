# Tutorial: Building a document timestamping contracts app in under 30 minutes

Document timestamping is the process of proving that a document existed at a certain time, usually, without revealing the contents of that document to the entity doing the timestamping. Examples include financial reports, predictions about the future, invoices and so on.

By inserting a hash into the block chain using a special transaction output type, called an OP_RETURN output, we can build a timestamping app on top of Bitcoin. This video tutorial shows how.
