<p>bitcoinj is a Java implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, which allows it to maintain a wallet and send/receive transactions without needing a local copy of Bitcoin Core. It comes with full documentation and some example apps showing how to use the library. <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj">Get the code on github!</a></p>

<h2>bitcoinj features</h2>

<ul class="features">
  <li>Highly optimised <b>lightweight simplified payment verification</b> (SPV) mode. In this mode, only a small part of the block chain is downloaded, making bitcoinj suitable for usage on constrained devices like smartphones or cheap virtual private servers.</li>
  <li>Experimental <b>full verification mode</b>, which does the same verification work as Bitcoin Core. In this mode, the unspent transaction output set (UTXO set) is calculated and, thanks to a PostgreSQL store, can be indexed into a database allowing for fast lookup of balance by address.</li>
  <li>A <b>wallet class</b> with encryption, fee calculation, multi-signing, deterministic key derivation, pluggable coin selection/coin control, extensions support and event listeners that let you stay up to date with changes in your balance.</li>
  <li>Support for <b>micropayment channels</b> that let you set up a multi-signature contract between client and server, and then negotiate on the channel, allowing fast micropayments that avoid miner fees.</li>
  <li>Provides both <b>async and thread-per-connection</b> for network IO, allowing you to choose between scalability and blocking-only features like SOCKS/Tor proxying.</li>
  <li>Easily implement apps that use Bitcoin's <b>contracts features</b>.</li>
  <li>A simple GUI wallet demo that you can use as the basis for your own apps.</li>
  <li><b>Command line tool</b> for working with wallet and chain files.</li>
  <li>Strong <a href="/bitcoin-standards"><b>Bitcoin standards</b></a> support.</li>
  <li>A friendly and helpful <a href="/#community"><b>community</b></a>!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting started</h1>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/releases/tag/v0.11" class="downloadlink">download the library as a JAR</a>, or <a href="/using-maven">use Maven</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj">get the code from github</a>. Then read:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Satoshi's white paper</a> - the bitcoinj documentation assumes basic familiarity with how Bitcoin works, the structure of transactions and the block chain.</li>
  <li><a href="/getting-started">Getting started</a> - a step by step tutorial on how to write a simple app that just forwards any money it receives.</li>
